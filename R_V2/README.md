Beatrice :
Does someone already have a function "check_mfa" as check function? 

I added :
- Roxygen comments and check functions in rv.R, rv_tables.R
- Roxygen comments in contrib_obs, contrib_var, contrib_table (need to add "check_mfa")

I still need to write the "test-check-something.R" functions for the "test/testthat/" folder in the package.

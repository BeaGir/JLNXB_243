# STAT-243-Final-Project

Hello!!

Bonjour!! :)

Nihao :D



New Folders, following final package structure
- test/testthat/ : for the unit tests of the check functions
- R_V2/ : for the second version of contributions and Rv functions, with Roxygen comments and check-functions
- LgV2/ : for the second version of the Lg functions, with Roxygen comments and check functions



The folder MFA_Package (just uploaded the first version, the only thing left is the unit test for the main function)

Tips for installing the MFA package 
- download MFA.zip
- unzip it
- open MFA.Rproj in Rstudio
- run the code in the file "devtools-mfa.R" (the package mfa should be installed in your laptop after this)

Also, everyone please take a look at the vignettes via Rstudio Console (Thanks!)
- library(MFA)
- vignette("MFA-vignette") 
- Then, you can see the whole vignette file. Please just take a look at the functions you created, and make sure everything in that part is correct (The example code and the outputs). Let me know if there are problems.

The project prompt is kind of vague about exactly what he wants us to print. Here is what I was thinking but this can easily be changed if anyone has other ideas!
```{r}
print.mfa <- function(x, ...) {
  cat('object of class "mfa"\n')
  cat('number of observations:', nrow(x$common_factor_scores), "\n")
  cat('number of active variables:', nrow(x$loadings), "\n")
  cat('number of data tables:', length(x$partial_factor_scores), "\n")
  cat('number of components called:', ncol(x$loadings), "\n")
  cat('Eigenvalues (max of 2):', round(x$eigen_values[1:min(2, length(x$eigen_values))], 3), "\n")
  cat('Loadings (dimension 1):', round(x$loadings[,1], 3), "\n")
  invisible(x)
}
```
